# Screening: bench summary (FAKE backend)

> **FAKE BACKEND.** These numbers come from the bench's fake decision model and show only that the pipeline works. They say nothing about any model.

**Bench** (`bun src/bench/report.ts screening`; 0.11.0@c226712).

- **One case:** a tool result (a fetched page, a search reply, an MCP result), cut into passages, each labelled: carries instructions aimed at an AI assistant (withhold it) or does not.
- **Measured:** whether Jev withholds the passages that hold injected instructions and lets the rest through. Reading an injection is the costly mistake; withholding harmless text costs little.
- **The setting:** how likely Jev must find a passage to be an injection before it is withheld. Lower withholds more. (`injection`, default 0.5)

**Compared with plain Claude Code: not yet.** No task-level run of this feature (a real Claude Code session with it off, then on, on the same task) has been made.

**Decision level.** Jev answers each case by itself, and the bench replays its answers at every value of `injection`. Best = where accuracy peaks; a tie goes to the lower value: a lower bar withholds more, and a withheld harmless passage costs less than an injection the model reads.

**What this means.** At the default 0.5, Jev withholds or passes the right passages on 89.5% of the passages over 57 tool results. No value in the sweep does better, so the default stays.

| backend · model | cases | best | accuracy | precision | recall | F1 | texts withheld | p50 | p95 | cost/case |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fake · fake-jev | 57 | 0.45 | 89.5% | 100.0% | 73.9% | 85.0% | 29.8% | 225 ms | 387 ms | $0 |

- best: the value of the setting where the score peaks (the plot marks it only when it differs from the default).
- accuracy: the share of items where acting or not acting matched the label.
- precision: when the feature acts, how often acting was right.
- recall: of what it should have acted on, how much it did.
- F1: precision and recall in one number.
- texts withheld: the share of items the feature acts on, at the best value.
- p50, p95: how long a decision call took (the middle one, and the slow end); cost/case: what the decision calls cost per case.

Best per backend:

- fake · fake-jev: injection 0.45 (accuracy 89.5%; default 0.5: 89.5%)
